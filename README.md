Carrie’s Fashion Store Sales Report, 2019.

Introduction: 
The clothing store industry is a fast changing market that is driven by trends, seasons and customer preferences. Understanding customer behaviour and sales patterns is vital for businesses to thrive. Therefore, this analysis seeks to understand customer purchasing patterns, behaviour and preferences and provide recommendations for business growth. 

Objectives:
 1) To determine which season generates the most revenue.
2) To understand differences in purchasing behaviour between male and female gender.
3) To identify top performing locations. 

Methodology:
The next step taken for this analysis was to input the data in a pivot table to find the relationship between variables.
